# The Threat and Vulnerability Landscape

> This objective in this lesson is foundation principal of Security, Privacy and Anonymity. How this principle apply to any given situation and your personaly. We have to understand relationship and contradiction between security, privacy and anonymity. The principle learn in this lesson need to be retained in your mind and applied.

Time is precious. So you have to spend out little is possible fiddling in security. We can get in we can actually we want to do. You want to get your best returned to investment of your time to apply your security. To ensure to protect what you value most and apply enoughf security. So we can do the thing we want to do safely online.

We have to ask ourself,

	- What is most confidential to us?
	- What can not we afford to lose?
	- What is irreplaceable?
	- What would cause the most damage?
	- What might impact us reputation?

Example of reputaion,
- Photo
- Credit card details
- Bank accound details
- Personal information
- Accound information - bank, Linkedin, Amazon, Payple and other social network
- Primary Email
- Bitcoin Wallet
- Browser history
- Personal document
- Password information
- extra

Think about if anyone is stolen, destroyed, cryptid or place in the internet or hands of criminal! Now make a list of this things and how much you really care about of them.

We referred to this as your **Security Assets**. This is a things your care about most. Little post for example spending our backup files we can simply replace and not takeing extra special care you can not replace. So the purpose of this most of your afford on the things we value and care about and spend much less afford wasting time on the things you really do not care about or can be replased quite easily.

## Privacy and Anonymity

Two other things we may value daily of privacy and anonymity which is relate to some of our assets to important to us. We wish our online information will secure and privacy and our identy will anonymity. But **Privacy** and **Anonymity** are note the same things.

**Privacy** means no body seen what we do in online and potentially knowing who we are. Privacy is about content and maintaining confidentiality and keep in secret. We can given example just like that, if you send a encrypted email to a friend and only you and he can read it. Another exaple, if your registered a cloud storage provider like dropbox that you are not annonymous but if you encrypted this files and only you have the key then the data is private and you have privacy. You have in your home and know body know what you do your home but you are not annonymous and everybody knows you lived there.

**Anonymity** means knowbody knowing who you are but potentially seen what you do. Anonymity is keeping your actuon and activity seperate from your true activity. Anonymity is when old possible people there is an equal chance and it could be anyone. You may desire this from in your content but not for macking it. Anonymity is known attribution to your actuons, to be nameless to be faceless. We can give example like this, you can connect to the internet through an annonymous service like tor and post a message about resistance under annonymous username, may be a country that is a crime. Your identy is annonymous separate from your true identy and your message is receive and not private. This is anonymity. If you connect to a website with *Virtual Private Network (VPN)* you are potentially an annonymous user to that website. And when you post a meesage a fourm that message is not private.

And there is a variant anatomy that people sometime use thats called **Pseudonymity**.

**Pseudonymity** is when you wish to reputaion againest identy. A common example is having an alias for social media and from online and this picture is none and adversary is who the bluebug user is then can attribute post an activities to him or her. This is a alias or cover of false side identy.

May be you understand is know that what is Privacy, Anonymity and Pseudonymity. Often the three terms to changeably event I make the mistake myself. So, it is important to understand to know the difference. Because the difference solution provide privacy over anonymity and pseudonymity.

One of the most interesting things of modern times is **Satoshi Nakamoto** who created **Bitcoin**. If you not familiar that who he is then click [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto) and know you can reading for extra fun.

Most country you have the [Right to Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy) and anonymity, if you choose protected your law. In most country stealing your personal and private information is a crime. But we know what is truth is. This is most important to know how to keep secret our privacy and anonymity.
